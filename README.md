Project Title: Alteration in the gut microbiome and changes in bone metabolism after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy

Project Description:
This is an ancillary analysis to a prospective cohort study where adults aged 24-70 with severe obesity underwent calcium metabolism and skeletal health assessment preoperatively and 6 months after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Calcium intake and vitamin D status were standardized throughout study participation. Major xclusion criteria include perimenopausal, conditions or medication known to impact bone and mineral metabolism, and significant comorbid conditions such as liver and kidney failure. This ancillary study included the 23 participants who provided stool samples at both preoperative and 6-months postoperative timepoints. Gut microbial profiling was done with 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
